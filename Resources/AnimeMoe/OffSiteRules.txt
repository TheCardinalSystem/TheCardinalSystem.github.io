1) Respect Staff:
	If a moderator tells you to stop doing something, stop. Don't argue with them. If you have an issue with their decision, message me or an admin.

	Don't start drama of any kind whether or it be on this server or another.
4) No NSFW:
	NSFW media isn't allowed in any channel. There are others websites for that ;)

	Pretty self explanatory.
6) No overarching lewd role play shit:
	Also self explanatory.
